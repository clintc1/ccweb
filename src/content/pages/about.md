![Clinton Cawood](/clintoncawood.png)

I've been writing about drinks for nearly two decades, since landing in the UK in 2006 from South Africa, where I'd already put in more than a few hours on both sides of the bar while studying journalism. 

After working in-house at *The Drinks Business* and *Imbibe*, I went freelance in 2017, covering all aspects of the industry, with a particular interest in spirits, cocktails and bars. I regularly contribute to titles such as *Class*, *Decanter*, *Foodism*, *The Spirits Business*, *Drinks International*, and many more. 

I'm a judge for the International Spirits Challenge, The Global Spirits Masters and People's Choice Drinks Awards, and a team leader at the World Alcohol Free Awards.
